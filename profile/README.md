# Kara Powered

Kara Powered is a project that attempts to create an alternative to [Bukkit](https://bukkit.org)/[Spigot](https://spigotmc.org)/[Paper](https://papermc.io). Since they are all based on the original code from [Mojang](https://minecraft.net), it is not possible to change _game-breaking_ mechanisms like player authentication. The main focus of this project is a more open API, so the server does not implement very many vanilla features, such as _advanced_ redstone, etc.

**Disclaimer**: The project is currently under development, so if you find any bugs, feel free to report them in a GitHub issue.

This project was written entirely in Java. The minimum/exclusive Java version tested is Java 18.0.2.

I hope this project will be useful to someone, Kara ðŸ¤—
